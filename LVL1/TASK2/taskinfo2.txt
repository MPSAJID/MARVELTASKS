ASYNC JS :
Learning about asynchronous javascript and implementing a small 
callback function which means a function which is passed as an 
argument to another function , when the outer function is called 
the inner function is also called . 
for large programs due to complex nesting as arguments the program
becomes difficult to debug and creates a situation called callback hell.
here is a program which displays recipe using callback function.
