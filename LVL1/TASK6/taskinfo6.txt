LINUX CONTINUED :
in this task we learn about regular expressions(regex) and grep.
then we take the login info with the command last an dwith the tag -s which means 'since'.
then this information is piped (|) and using grep we find the logins of the month of august and the
output is saved in a file called loginfo.txt .
then it is moved to a folder named logs and then it is zipped using the tar cvzf command ,which combines tar and gzip.
